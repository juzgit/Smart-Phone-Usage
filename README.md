Download Individual Files
If you only want to download a specific file:

Navigate to the file within the repository on GitHub.
Click on the file name to open it.
Once the file is open, click the "Raw" button located near the top-right of the file view.
This will open the raw file content in a new tab.
Right-click and choose "Save As" to download the file to your local machine.
For .pbix files, GitHub will prompt you to save the file directly.
